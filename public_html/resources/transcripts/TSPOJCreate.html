<h3>Creating a New Project</h3>
<p>Projects are created inside the <i>Projects Module</i> by </p>
<ul>
	<li>clicking on the <i>Project</i> button on the toolbar,</li>
	<li>Clicking on the little <i>Dropdown</i> arrow on the left-most button on the toolbar and selecting <i>Project</i> in the pop-up menu</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <i>Project Creation dialog box</i> the user must fill in the following information and click the <i>Create</i> button:</p>
<h4>Project Auto Code Generation</h4>
<p>This option is visible to the user, if the user has the relevant <i>User Rights</i>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>With this option ticked, PowerOffice will auto-select a unique code for the project. The <i>Project Code</i> and <i>Project Description</i> 
		fields will be <i>inactive</i>, grayed out.
	</li>
	<li>With this option un-ticked, the user <b>MUST</b> fill in his / her own unique project code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Code</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This is the <i>Unique</i> identifying code for the project.</li>
	<li>It must not be blank.</li>
	<li>It must be unique within the <i>Project Source</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Add as a child of Project n</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Ticking this option allows the user to create the new project <i>inside</i> an existing project, as a <i>sub-project</i> of the selected project.</li>
	<li>Unticking this option will create the project on <i>Top Level</i>. I.e. directly under, or as a "stand-alone" project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Attributes</h4>
<p>Once the user clicks the <i>Create</i> button, the <i>Project Attributes</i> dialog box appears. Attributes are set for all records in the database.<br>
	<i>Attribute values</i> are changed by highlighting the <i>attribute</i> to change and selecting a value from the drop-down list at the bottom of the 
	dialog box or, if a list is not available, the <i>attribute</i> is a custom attribute, and is updated by typing the new value into the field. 
	In both cases, clicking the <i>Update Value</i> button on its right will save the changes.</p>
<p>Filters are available on the <i>Attributes</i> dialog box, which allow the user to display or hide certain attributes and their values.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the values entered into the <i>New Project</i> dialog box and the <i>Project Attributes</i> dialog box can be 
	changed at a later stage. This is done by selecting the project where the change is to be made, right clicking it and selecting Edit.</p>
<p>This selection brings up the <i>Project</i> dialog box which will allow the user to change the code and description. PowerOffice will 
	prevent the user from duplicating a <i>Project Code</i> by showing an error message.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Attributes</i> instead of <i>Edit</i>, opens the <i>Attributes</i> dialog box, allowing the user to make changes as needed.</p>
