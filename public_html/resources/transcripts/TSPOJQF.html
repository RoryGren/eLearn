<h3>Using the Filters</h3>
<p>The Filter system is standard and is used in the same way throughout PowerOffice, in all modules. They are located at the top of each panel and, for the 
	most, contain the same features and options.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Source</i> - this is a subset of the database. It is simply a container, and can be to separate different project types, different regions, different Operating Units, etc. for 
		different <i>sets</i> of data. Changing the <i>Source</i> will limit the subset of data available to the user for the BOM.</li>
	<li><i>Version</i> - as usual in PowerOffice, the <i>Version</i> is where the "nuts and bolts" are found. It contains the actual structures and end-items that 
		can be used to build the BOM. A <i>Source</i> can contain multiple <i>Versions</i> and each <i>Version</i> within a <i>Source</i> could be for material available 
		for different groupings or stages or time periods.Changing the <i>Version</i> changes the data available to the user accordingly.</li>
	<li><b><i>Quick Filter</i></b> - Type any combination of letters and numbers in this field, the  <i>filter value</i>, and activate by pressing <i>Enter</i>. 
		This will return a "result set" where PowerOffice has matched the filter value in any combination of three columns - 
		the <b><i>Description</i></b>, the <b><i>Code</i></b> and / or the <b><i>Alt Code</i></b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Reminder</u>: - to display the <i>Alt Code</i> column, click on <i>Tools</i> in the menu, select <i>Options</i> 
	and put a tick in the <i>Display Alternate Code</i> column. To hide the column, follow the same process and remove the tick.</p>
