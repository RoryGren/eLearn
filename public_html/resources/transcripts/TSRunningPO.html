<h3>Running PowerOffice</h3>
<p>PowerOffice can be started up in a number of different ways, much like any 
		Windows programme. These might look slightly different, depending on which 
		version of Windows you are using.</p>
<ol>
	<li>By default, the PowerOffice installation process puts a shortcut into your start menu.<br>
		The start menu options are usually arranged in alpha-numeric order. <br>
		Sometimes, there are "Favourites" or "Recently Used" shortcuts at the top of the list.<br><br>
