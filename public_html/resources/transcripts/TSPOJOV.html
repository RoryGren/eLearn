<h3>General Overview of the PowerOffice Projects Module.</h3>
<p>Select the Projects tab at the bottom left of the PowerOffice window.</p>
<p>As with most PowerOffice windows, the Projects window is split into two:</p>
<h4>Main screen area</h4>

<h5>Right Hand side:</h5>
<p>This contains the <i>templates</i> of all the packages, structures, end items, etc. that are available to you to build up the contents 
	of your project, or your BOM.</p>

<h5>Left Hand side:</h5>
<p>This is where the work happens, where all the "nuts and bolts" of your project will go. This will contain all your projects - the little folders</p>
<h4>Top of the screen:</h4>

<h5>The Menu Bar:</h5>
<p>File, Edit, Tools, Help. These have drop-down menus that allow you to perform different tasks and change settings or preferences in PowerOffice.</p>

<h5>The Tool Bar:</h5>
<p>This has a row of buttons that are short-cuts to certain, often-used, routines -</p>
	<ul>
		<li>These can be <i>active</i> or <i>inactive</i> - greyed-out - depending on what has been selected in the main screen and whether or not the button's 
		function can be performed on the selected record.</li>
		<li>These buttons can change, also depending on settings and what has been selected in the main screen.</li>
		<li>Notice that there are <b>TWO</b> toolbars, each above a different half of the window. They work on their respective sides of the main window.
			I.e. The toolbar above the left hand side works on the left hand side of the window and the toolbar above the right hand side, similarly, 
			works on the right hand side of the window.<br>
			There are therefore <b>TWO</b> <i>Refresh</i> buttons - one on the left and one on the right. They each work only on their respective sides of the window.</li>
	</ul>

<h5>Filters:</h5>
<p>Just below the toolbar, we have a set of filters.</p>
<p>These are used to find a record - a project, a structure, an end-item, etc. - or to reduce the number of records shown on the screen.</p>
<p>Again, one set of filters on the left hand side of the screen and another set on the right hand side of the screen.</p>

<h5>Status Bars:</h5>
<p>These narrow bars, immediately below the main windows, one on the left and one on the right, display feedback from the database to the user.
	In most cases, as they do here, in the Projects module, they show the number of records that have been returned from the database and the number currently being displayed.</p>
<p>Right at the very bottom of the screen is the main status bar, which gives you feedback about the database type, name, instance, version, etc. you are connected to, 
	as well as the username you are logged in as and what modules are available to that user.</p>
<h5>Audit Fields</h5>
<p>Between the Status Bars and the module tabs, we have the Audit Fields - the <i>"Who dunnit?" fields</i>. 
	Again, one for the left and one for the right. These display create and modify information about the selected record in the main panel above.</p>
