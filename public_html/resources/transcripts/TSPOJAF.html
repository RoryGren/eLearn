<h3>Using the Advanced Filter</h3>
<p>The <i>"Advanced" Filter</i> as a little more sophisticated than the <i>Quick Filter</i>, in that, over and above filtering on the 
	Description, Code and Alt Code columns, it will also filter on <i>Attributes</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Advanced Filter</i> is started by clicking on the <i>ellipsis</i> button. <i>(The square button with three dots '...')</i>
	This opens up the <i>Advanced Filter</i> dialog box, which contains the following fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On the left hand side, the <i>Attribute</i> drop down box.</li>
	<li>In the centre, the <i>Operator</i>.</li>
	<li>On the right hand side, the <i>Value</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the <i>Attribute</i> selected,</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <i>Operator</i> will have different values available,</li>
	<li>and the <i>Value</i> will either have values in a drop-down list, or be an empty field which can have custom values typed into it.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Buttons</h5>
<p>Clicking the <i>PLUS</i> button adds a row to the filter criteria for additional filter options.</p>
<p>Clicking the <i>Delete</i> button to the left of the <i>PLUS</i> button, removes that row from the filter criteria.</p>
<p>Clicking the <i>OK</i> button activates the filter, closing the dialog box and putting a tick in the <i>Filter</i> check box 
	to show that the <i>Advanced Filter</i> is active. Removing the tick by clicking it, de-activates the filter and returns PowerOffice 
</p>
<p>Clicking the <i>X</i> or <i>Cancel</i> button to the right of the <i>OK</i> button, cancels the current filter operation.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> 
<ol>
	<li>PowerOffice will remember the last used advanced filter AND Quick Filter settings. Simply putting a tick into the <i>Filter</i> 
		checkbox will re-activate it. PowerOffice will show the remembered search criterea to the right of the ellipsis button.</li>
	<li>The <i>Advanced Filter</i> and the <i>Quick Filter</i> work <u>in conjunction</u> with each other. 
		I.e. The result set returned by the one will be further filtered by the other.</li>
