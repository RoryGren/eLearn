<h3>What is PowerOffice?</h3>
<p>At its core, PowerOffice is a Costing Engine.</p>
<p>It is a database, a list of records of end items and containers, called <i>Packages</i>, which link these end items together.</p>
<p>These <i>Packages</i> can themselves be nested in a parent / child relationship to create larger structures. 
	They are represented by folder icons and, at the lowest level, contain <i>end-items</i>.</p>
<p>These <i>end-items</i> and <i>packages</i> can have numerous attributes, such as pricing and project types, 
	which can be used for grouping for filtration and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>The system consists of two "parts" - the <i>client</i> and the <i>server</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Server</i> component is the database engine. It can be installed on a local computer or on a dedicated server computer 
which can then be used by multiple clients at the same time.</p>
<p>The <i>Client</i> component it the programme that is installed on the computer that the end user works with, the<i>interface</i>. 
	It communicates with the database and presents the information to the user in an understandable way.</p>
