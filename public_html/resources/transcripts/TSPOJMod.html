<h3>Modifying your Project</h3>
<p><u>Quantities</u> can be modified in two ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Right click the relevant record - package or end-item - select <i>Edit</i> and, in the dialog box, 
		change the quantity to the desired number and click <i>OK</i>.</li>
	<li>Click twice slowly, not double-click, <u>on the actual quantity you want to change</u> in the grid. PowerOffice will open the 
		quantity for changing in a little block, and then pressing <i>Enter</i> writes the change into the database.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Removing a package or end-item from the BOM</h5>
<ul>
	<li>In the project <i>hierarchy</i> there is a ticked check box to the left of every record. 
		Removing the tick marks the relevant record as inactive and changes the ticks to grey blocks 
		in the parent container record all the way up the hierarchy to the <i>top-level</i> package in the <i>Version</i>.
		This grey block and un-ticked block then serves as a record of changes to what was the "standard template," 
		which can be reversed, or added back, simply by putting the tick back into the box.
	</li>
	<li>A second way of removing something from the BOM is by right-clicking the relevant record and selecting <i>Delete</i>.<br>
		<b><u>Warning</u>:</b> This second method cannot be undone. It also has no indication as to what has been changed from the standard template. <u>Use with caution.</u></li>
</ul>
