<h3>Importing and Exporting Data with PowerOffice.</h3>
<p>In order to use PowerOffice, we need to have relevant data, packages, structures, end-items, etc,
	to build up our BOM.</p>
<p>If we want to exchange data with another person who has his / her own PowerOffice database, 
	our data - the recipient's and the sender's - needs to be synchronised.</p>
<p>If you send a project to another user and you have a package template ABC that you use in your BOM. If 
	the person you send to does NOT have that exact same package template in his database, your project 
	will NOT be able to be imported into his database. There will be missing data.</p>
<p>It is vitally important then, to maintain the integrity of your database and for data to be exchanged successfully, 
	for you to be able to import and export data, both project and Source, or templates.</p>
