<h3>Project and Version Attributes</h3>
<p>An <b>Attribute</b> is "additional" information for a particular record in PowerOffice that can help with </p>
<ul>
	<li>filtering,</li>
	<li>categorizing and placing of information in reports, and</li>
	<li>prioritizing of applications in the toolbar.</li></ul>
<p>Project Version Attributes inherit the first three values from the parent <i>Project Attributes</i>. I.e.</p>
<ul><li><i>Project Type,</i></li>
	<li><i>Project Engineering Stage</i> and</li>
	<li><i>Project Approval Stage.</i></li></ul>
<p>These values can be changed and do not necessarily need to be the same as those of the parent.</p>
<p>Changing the values is done by highlighting the <i>Attribute</i> in the grid and making any changes at the bottom of the dialog box, either 
	by clicking the drop-down arrow and making a selection form the list provided, or, if there is no list, typing the required 
	value into the field, and then finally clicking the <i>Update Value</i> button.</p>
<p>The <u>fourth</u> attribute value is particularly important for projects using the <u>PO Electrification</u> application. 
	The value here determines the folder name to be used for <i>project-specific</i> files and rules that PowerOffice will create and use.</p>
<p><i>Material Reservation Status</i> is only to be used by Eskom. It must remain <u>Not Ready</u> until the project is complete and 
	a reservation needs to be made in SAP.<br><b>Once this is changed to <i>Ready</i>, the selected Project Version will be <u>locked</u> for editing 
	and <u>no more changes will be possible</u>.</b></p>
<p>The remaining attributes pertain to costing and require an annual percentage to be entered to be added to the material cost of the selected version.</p>
