<h3>Logging in to PowerOffice.</h3>
<p>Logging in to PowerOffice is a simple process, but can be frustrating if a user forgets his or her
password!</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fill in the correct <b><u>Login Name</u></b> and <b><u>Password</u></b>. These are user defined and will probably be allocated to you by your organisation.
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure you don't forget your password. If you do, an administrator will need to re-set your password for you.
				(There is a default User Name with no password. This should only be used for the initial setup. 
				Thereafter, only use the User Name allocated to you by your organisation.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make sure the correct server installation is selected by putting the radio button dot in the 
		correct position. (Most users will use <i>Microsoft SQL Server</i> - <b>MSSQL</b>)</li>
	<li>This will change the server block below to request the relevant parameters for connecting to the database.
		<ul>
			<li>For MSSQL Server:
				<ul>
					<li><b><u>Server Name</u></b> requires the name of the computer where the database engine has been installed. 
						<ul>
							<li>If you have a <b>stand-alone</b> installation, i.e. everything will run on your computer and there will be 
							no other computer connecting to PowerOffice on your computer across a network,
							you will type in the name of your own computer here - the <i>local computer</i>. The exact name.<br>
							PowerOffice will suggest the name of the local computer for you.</li>
							<li>If you have a <b>client-server</b> setup, i.e. you have a dedicated server which runs
							the PowerOffice MSSQL database engine and your computer connects to it across a network, 
							you will type in the name, or the IP address of the server here. The exact name. If necessary, your
							IT support team can help you here.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b><u>Instance</u></b> requires just that, the MSSQL <i>Instance</i> on the server. 
						With PowerOffice, this is <i>IIPower</i> (Not <i>"Two Power"</i>, the letter 'I' - Aye-aye Power!)<br>
						If you have a dedicated server, your administrator will need to open up a 'Port' in the 
						server firewall to allow outside computers to access the database engine.The users must then "tell" 
						their computer what port to use on the server.<br>
						This is done by following the Instance with a comma and the port number - no spaces.</li>
					<li><b><u>Database</u></b> requires the database name to connect to, inside the instance of MSSQL. The PowerOffice 14 
						database will be <i>PowerOffice14</i>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>For Oracle:
				<ul>
					<li><li><b><u>ORA DB(SID)</u></b> requires the database SID. This is like the database name on the server.</li>
					<li><b><u>Server Name</u></b> this requires the name of the computer where the database engine has been installed. 
						<ul>
							<li>If you have a <b>stand-alone</b> installation, i.e. everything will run on your computer and there will be 
							no other computer connecting to PowerOffice on your computer across a network,
							you will type in the name of your own computer here - the <i>local computer</i>. The exact name.<br>
							PowerOffice will suggest the name of the local computer for you.</li>
							<li>If you have a <b>client-server</b> setup, i.e. you have a dedicated server which runs
							the PowerOffice Oracle database engine and your computer connects to it across a network, 
							you will type in the name, or the IP address of the server here. The exact name. If necessary, your
							IT support team can help you here.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b><u>Port</u></b> requires the port number of the port that is opened for outside computers to access your 
						database. PowerOffice defaults to port number 1521.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
