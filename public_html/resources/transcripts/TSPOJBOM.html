<h3>Building your BOM</h3>
<p>This is all done from the main screen in the Projects Module.</p>
<p>The left hand side of the screen contains the projects and versions - the workspace where we will work, modify and manipulate our BOM.</p>
<p>The right hand side of the screen contains the templates for all the potential material and structure configurations and combinations 
	that could be needed for our BOM.</p>
<p>Remembering that PowerOffice works on <i>selected records</i>, the project version that has been created and is to be used for our BOM needs to be 
	visible, so we double-click on the relevant project and, if necessary, sub-projects, until the version becomes visible. (The <i>Version</i> 
	is where the "nuts and bolts" of our project will be contained.)</p>
