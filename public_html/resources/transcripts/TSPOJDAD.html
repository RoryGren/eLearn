<h3>Dragging and Dropping</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The <i>Version</i> to be used MUST be exposed in order for it to be populated.<br>
		- Double click the relevant project to drill down until the relevant <i>Version</i> is exposed and available.<br>
		- If the selected package is dropped onto a <i>Project</i>, PowerOffice will give an error and NOT complete the <i>Drag and Drop</i>.<br>
		<b>Remember:</b> The "nuts and bolts" of the project are kept in the <i>Version</i>.
	</li>
	<li>Standard Windows multi-select can be used to select packages to add to the <i>Project Version</i>.<br>
		Shift-Click, Control-Click and Mouse-dragging can be used.<br>
		<b>Warning:</b> Dragging to multi-select on the right hand side of the screen can make undesirable selections. Be careful when using this method.</li>
	<li>Be aware of where you <b>drop</b> your selected packages and items.<br>
		<b>Remember:</b> PowerOffice works with <u>selected</u> records. With dragging and dropping, the selection 
		can be dropped into <i>Versions</i> AND <u>any highlighted package</u>.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended that the <i>icon</i> is used for dragging the selection from the right hand side to the <i>version</i> or parent package in the project.</p>
