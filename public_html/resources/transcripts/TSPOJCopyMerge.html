<h3>Copying and Merging</h3>
<h5>Copy and Paste</h5>
<p>We know that there is no <i>Copy / Paste</i> on the templates pane, the right hand side of the screen. However, we can copy 
	and paste or drag and drop on the left hand side of the screen, inside our projects and versions.
</p>
<p>Copying packages, items and entire versions from one project, or version, to another can be done in standard Windows fashion:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Right click</i> the record you want to copy.<br>
		Select <i>Copy</i> in the pop-up menu.<br>
		<i>Right click</i> the new, parent location where you want to paste.<br>
		Select <i>Paste</i>.
	</li>
    <li><i>Highlight</i> the record you want to copy.<br>
		<i>Drag</i> it to the new, parent location where you want to put it.<br>
		<i>Drop</i> it.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>PowerOffice will change the pointer icon to a <i>No-Entry</i> sign when the "receiving" record is not valid.</p>
