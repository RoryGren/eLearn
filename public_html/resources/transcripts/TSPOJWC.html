<h3>Filtering with "Wild Cards"</h3>
<p>There are two <i>Wild Card</i> symbols that can be used as part of the search query with the PowerOffice database:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>%</b> - This is the <i>multiple character</i> wild card. It will allow itself to be replaced by <u>multiple characters</u>.</li>
	<li><b>_</b> - This is the <i>single character</i> wild card. It will allow itself to be replaced by a <u>single character</u> - one character only. 
		This option can be used multiple times to represent a specific number of characters in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> The <i>multiple character Wild Card</i> is <u>built in</u> to the <i>Advanced Filter</i>. You do NOT need to add it into your search query.</p>
