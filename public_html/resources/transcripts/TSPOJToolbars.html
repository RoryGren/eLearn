<h3>PowerOffice Projects Toolbars.</h3>
<p>Toolbars are a row of "buttons" below the menu bar. <br>
	They are shortcuts which usually perform actions on the entire screen, or  
	on <i>highlighted or selected records</i> in the screen below them.<br>
	Buttons sometimes have a drop-down arrow on their right, indicating that there is a sub-menu, 
	with further selections available to the user, accessed by clicking the drop-down arrow.<br>
	Buttons can sometimes be "grayed out," or inactive, indicating that the action they would perform cannot 
	be performed on the highlighted, or selected, record in the main screen below them.</p>
<p>In the Projects module the following buttons are available on the left-hand side of the screen:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Project: This button has a drop-down arrow with the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Project: which is used to create new projects.</li>
			<li>Version: Create a new project version inside the highlighted project.</li>
			<li>User Item: Create a User Item, which is a "buy-out" item, I.e. an item which is NOT 
			in the database, but the cost of which, still needs to be added to the project. This User Item will 
			NOT be sent through to SAP with the Material Reservation.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Cost: This button costs the project, or highlighted record and its children, according to the selections 
	made when the version is created.<br>
	The drop-down for this button allows the user to select <i>Quick Cost</i>, which will be discussed later in the course.</li>
	<li>App Button: This button allows access to various additional applications which become available to the user, 
	depending on the selection in the main screen:
